# Goals
    + Provide meaningful data to social scientist about censorship
    + Enhance our advantage in the Arms race (gather evidence of censorship)
    + Inform the tester if he's being censored

# Requirements
    + Ease to use
        ++ Automated censorship testing
        ++ Automated reporting
        ++ click and go
        ++ provide a meaningful summary
    + Anonymous (difficult to detect)
        ++ In the executions of tests
        ++ In the reporting (pcap information and connection with the oonib)
    + Use OONI framework
    + cross-platform (with twisted?????)

# Sources
    + torproject.org reachability

    + bridge reachability

# Techniques
    + DNS spoofing
    + keyword filtering
    + IP blocking
    + DPI (transport level)
    + obfuscated traffic (obfs)
